# Engineering Manager Templates
These templated could be used by any development manager / leader.  I found myself collecting several templates over the years and thought it was time to share some knowledge to help kickstart those new managers out in the wild wild tech west.
Files (markdown) templates for diverse engineering leadership manager roles.  All the templates are in the root of this repo.

1. [Postmortem](postmortem.md)  used for a reflection after an incident.
